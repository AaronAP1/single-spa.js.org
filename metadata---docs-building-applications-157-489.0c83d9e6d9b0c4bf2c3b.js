In a single-spa world, your SPA contains many registered applications, where each has its own framework. Registered applications have their own client-side routing and their own frameworks/libraries. They render their own html and have full freedom to do whatever they want, whenever they are *mounted*. The concept of being *mounted* refers to whether a registered application is putting content on the DOM or not. What determines if a registered application is mounted is its [activity function](single-spa-config.md#activity-function). Whenever a registered application is *not mounted*, it should remain completely dormant until mounted.","source":"@site/../docs/building-applications.md","permalink":"/docs/building-applications","sidebar":"docs","next":{"title":"Splitting up applications","permalink":"/docs/separating-applications"},"previous":{"title":"Using single-spa-config","permalink":"/docs/configuration"},"editUrl":"https://github.com/CanopyTax/single-spa.js.org/blob/master/docs/building-applications.md"}')}}]);
