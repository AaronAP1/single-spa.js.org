There are a variety of single-spa example repositories, each for different use cases:
- [simple-single-spa-webpack-example](https://github.com/joeldenning/simple-single-spa-webpack-example) is a small, simple example that can be used as a webpack starter.
- [coexisting-angular-microfrontends](https://github.com/joeldenning/coexisting-angular-microfrontends) is a full blown Angular 7 microfrontends
repo that combines three separate Angular CLI projects into one page.
- [single-spa-es5-angularjs](https://github.com/joeldenning/single-spa-es5-angularjs) is a very tiny es5 example with angularjs.
- [single-spa-portal-example](https://gitlab.com/TheMcMurder/single-spa-portal-example) shows an approach of separating into multiple single-spa applications
and using common dependencies between applications by using systemjs@3.
- [single-spa-examples](https://github.com/CanopyTax/single-spa-examples) is where you can find a large example showcasing what single-spa can do. You can also visit the [live demo](http://single-spa.surge.sh) for single-spa-examples. This repo is not great for starting your project, but rather for demoing what single-spa
is capable of.
